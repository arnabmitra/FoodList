The study found that sesamin, a component of sesame, may have the ability to stimulate bone synthesis (5). In addition, sesame may provide some relief for those suffering from osteoarthritis. A human clinical trial found a significant difference in clinical signs and symptoms in those who ate 40 grams of sesame seeds daily during the two month study period (6), so maybe it’s not a bad idea to feed your aging four-legged baby some sesame.(https://www.zukes.com/fuel-the-love/dog-blog/sesame-nutrition-for-dogs)",Good

Cooked White Rice and Pasta,Dogs may enjoy plain white rice or pasta after it's cooked. A serving of plain white rice with some boiled chicken can also provide welcome relief from gastrointestinal upset.,Good
Asparagus,Asparagus is an entirely safe vegetable for your dog to eat. Besides being high in fiber, asparagus contains the vitamins A and C and folic acid. Either cooked or raw, some dogs like asparagus very much. As with any new food you are introducing to your dog's diet, it's best to do so gradually so that you can monitor any stomach upset it might cause. Cooking vegetables always improves digestibility. You should also be aware that the color of your dog's feces might become green if she eats too much asparagus. It is safe for your dog's diet to contain approximately 20% vegetables.Some people claim that giving asparagus to dogs uncooked can cause indigestion because, “Dogs will just wolf down whatever you put in front of them, they won’t take the time to chew up a piece of asparagus in their mouth until it’s ready to swallow. A couple of chomps and it will be down the hatch. It will probably cause problems coming out the other end too.” While this sounds reasonable, this is not completely accurate because just like humans have stomach acids and their digestive system is working continuously to break things down. I am not saying dogs are just like humans, but their digestive tract is not THAT different.There are also some people who believe dogs are carnivores and cannot eat vegetables. We believe this is incorrect despite the very convincing argument made by Fetch For Me Human that dogs are obligate carnivores. If you look at the back of bags of kibble (really, any one of them), you will see the mention of a variety of vegetables (and no, I am not just talking about corn). As with any new food you are introducing to your dog’s diet, it’s best to do so gradually so that you can monitor any stomach upset it might cause.,Good

Avocado,"Avocado leaves, fruit, seeds and bark contain a toxin called persin that can cause upset stomach and breathing difficulties.",Bad
Alcohol,"Even drinking a small amount of alcohol can result in significant intoxication for a dog, which can lead to vomiting, seizures and even death",Bad
Bread Dough,"Raw bread dough made with live yeast can be hazardous if ingested by dogs. When raw dough is swallowed, the warm, moist environment of the stomach provides an ideal environment for the yeast to multiply, resulting in an expanding mass of dough in the stomach. Expansion of the stomach may be severe enough to decrease blood flow to the stomach wall, resulting in the death of tissue. Additionally, the expanding stomach may press on the diaphragm, resulting in breathing difficulty. Perhaps more importantly, as the yeast multiplies, it produces alcohols that can be absorbed, resulting in alcohol intoxication. Affected dogs may have distended abdomens and show signs such as a lack of coordination, disorientation, stupor and vomiting (or attempts to vomit). In extreme cases, coma or seizures may occur and could lead to death from alcohol intoxication. Dogs showing mild signs should be closely monitored, and dogs with severe abdominal distention or dogs who are so inebriated that they can’t stand up should be monitored by a veterinarian until they recover.",Bad
Hops,"Cultivated hops used for brewing beer have been associated with potentially life-threatening signs in dogs who have ingested them. Both fresh and spent (cooked) hops have been implicated in poisoning dogs. Affected dogs develop an uncontrollably high body temperature (often greater than 108 degrees Fahrenheit), which results in damage to and failure of multiple organ systems. Dogs poisoned by hops become restless, pant excessively, and may have muscle tremors and seizures. Prompt veterinary intervention is necessary to prevent death in these dogs.",Bad
Macadamia Nuts,"Although macadamia nut toxicosis is unlikely to be fatal in dogs, it can cause very uncomfortable symptoms that may persist for up to 48 hours. Affected dogs develop weakness in their rear legs, appear to be in pain, may have tremors and may develop a low grade fever. Fortunately, these signs will gradually subside over 48 hours, but dogs experiencing more than mild symptoms can benefit from veterinary care, which may include intravenous fluid therapy and pain control. Moldy Foods",Bad
Moldy Foods,"A wide variety of molds grow on food. Some produce toxins called tremorgenic mycotoxins, which can cause serious or even life-threatening problems if ingested by dogs. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to determine whether a particular mold is producing tremorgenic mycotoxins, so the safest rule of thumb is to avoid feeding dogs moldy food. In other words, if you wouldn’t eat it, neither should your dog. Promptly remove any trash or moldy debris (road-kill, fallen walnuts or fruit, etc.) from your dog’s environment to prevent him from eating it. The signs of tremorgenic mycotoxin poisoning generally begin as fine muscle tremors that progress to very coarse total-body tremors and, finally, convulsions that can lead to death in severe cases. Left untreated, these tremors can last for several weeks. Fortunately, they usually respond well to appropriate veterinary treatment.",Bad
Xylitol,"is a non-caloric sweetener that is widely used in sugar-free gum, as well as in sugar-free baked products. In humans, xylitol does not affect blood sugar levels, but in dogs, ingestion of xylitol can lead to a rapid and severe drop in blood sugar levels. Dogs may develop disorientation and seizures within 30 minutes of ingesting xylitol-containing products, or signs may be delayed for several hours. Some dogs who ingest large amounts of xylitol develop liver failure, which can be fatal. All dogs ingesting xylitol-containing products should be examined by a veterinarian immediately.",Bad
"Coffe, Tea and Other Caffeen:","Caffeine in large enough quantities can be fatal. And there is no antidote. Symptoms of caffeine poisoning include restlessness, rapid breathing, heart palpitations, muscle tremors, fits, and bleeding. In addition to tea and coffee -- including beans and grounds -- caffeine can be found in cocoa, chocolate, colas, and stimulant drinks such as Red Bull. It's also in some cold medicines and pain killers.",Bad
Milk-Based products,"Milk and milk-based products can cause diarrhea and other digestive upset, as well as set up food allergies (which often show up as itchiness).",Bad
Macadamia Nuts,"Dogs shouldn't eat macadamia nuts or foods with them because they can be fatal. As few as six raw or roasted macadamias can make them ill. Symptoms of poisoning include muscle tremors, weakness or paralysis of the hindquarters, vomiting, elevated body temperature, and rapid heart rate. Eating chocolate with the nuts will make symptoms worse, possibly leading to death.",Bad
Candy and Gum,"Candy, gum, toothpaste, baked goods, and some diet foods are sweetened with xylitol. It can cause more insulin to circulate through your dog's body. That can cause his blood sugar to drop and can also cause liver failure. Initial symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, and loss of coordination. Eventually, he may have seizures. Liver failure can occur within just a few days.",Bad
Fat Trimmings and Bones,"Table scraps often contain meat fat that a human didn't eat as well as bones. Both are dangerous for dogs. Fat trimmed from meat, both cooked and uncooked, can cause pancreatitis. And, although it seems natural to give a dog a bone, he can choke on it. Bones can also splinter and cause an obstruction or lacerations of your dog's digestive system. It's best to just forget about the doggie bag.",Bad
"Persimmons, Peaches, and Plums","The problem with these fruits is the seeds or pits. The seeds from persimmons can cause inflammation of the small intestine in dogs. They can also cause intestinal obstruction. Obstruction is also a possibility if a dog eats the pit from a peach or plum. Plus, peach and plum pits contain cyanide, which is poisonous to both humans and dogs. The difference is humans know not to eat them. Dogs don't.",Bad
Raw Eggs,There are two problems with giving your dog raw eggs. The first is the possibility of food poisoning from bacteria like Salmonella or E. coli. The second is that an enzyme in raw eggs interferes with the absorption of a particular B vitamin. This can cause skin problems as well as problems with your dog's coat if she's been eating them for a long time.,Bad
Raw Meat and Fish,"Raw meat and raw fish, like raw eggs, can contain bacteria that causes food poisoning. In addition, certain kinds of fish such as salmon, trout, shad, or sturgeon can contain a parasite that causes ""fish disease"" or ""salmon poisoning disease."" If not treated, the disease can be fatal within 2 weeks. The first signs of illness are vomiting, fever, and big lymph nodes. Thoroughly cooking the fish will kill the parasite and protect your dog.",Bad
Avocados,The flesh of an avocado is safe for your dog. However the pit, if eaten, may cause an intestinal obstruction.
